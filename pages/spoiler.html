			It can be scary starting up a new business! People worry that they may lose all of their investment money, never mind the disappointment of possible failure. A government can make it easier for new business people by lessening the risk of starting and running a business through laws (also known as Acts) passed by its elected officials.  
		</p>
			
		<p>
			There are many laws relevant to businesses in Canada. An important piece of legislation is the Competition Act. It is a federal law governing most business conduct in Canada. It contains both criminal and civil provisions aimed at preventing anti-competitive practices in the marketplace.
