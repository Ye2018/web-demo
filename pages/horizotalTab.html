			Now that you’ve become more familiar with New Brunswick and local business support systems and organizations, it’s time to connect with an entrepreneur from your area for an interview. But before you do this, read these tips on how to conduct an effective interview.

						If an entrepreneur says the following to you, would you know how to respond?
					</p>
					<aside class="full quote">
						“I started with an incubator and after two product iterations, I had a disrupter! I’m not looking to be a unicorn, but I would like to be a bootstrapper.”
					</aside>
					<p>
						Make sure you review entrepreneurship vocabulary so you’re not left in the dark and looking unprepared.  
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="content02">
					<h2>Background research</h2>
					<p>
						Check various social media and economic development websites to gather basic information regarding your entrepreneur and their business.  
					</p>
					<h2>Preparing your questions:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Consider the purpose of the interview and what information you want from your interviewee</li>
						<li>Compose open-ended questions (questions that can’t be answered with a yes or a no)</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Preparing the technology</h2>
					<p>
						Nothing can throw an interview off more than technical difficulties. If your recording fails, it is embarrassing to have to ask for another interview—as well, the entrepreneur may not be willing to do another interview.
					</p>
					<p>
						Be sure to try out your technology before you conduct your interview, and consider all of the things that might go wrong so that you have well-planned options if something does go wrong.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="content03">
					<ul>
						<li>Do your research. Find out what you can about your subject and their business. The entrepreneur will consider you more of a professional if you come to the interview prepared.  </li>
						<li>See if you can find a common interest that will act like an ice breaker. “Did you watch that game last night” or “I read that you love to hike…” This sharing of interests can help to create a more comfortable environment and may initiate more details than you would otherwise have received. </li>
						<li>Speak clearly and confidently and remember, you’re there to gather information— not to talk about yourself.</li>
						<li>Listen attentively and try to sound conversational rather than reading from a script. If your subject hints at something that sounds interesting, respond with further questions. It is okay to break from your question script as long as you make sure that you ask all the questions you need answered. Put a mark beside the questions that are answered to your satisfaction so you can smoothly move to the questions that still need answering.</li>
